We provide fully trained UNet segmentation weights for WSI IHC synovial tissue which can be used as the first step in an automated image analysis pipeline. It is robust to common WSIs artefacts, clinical centre/scanner batch effect and can be used on different types of IHC stains. It can be used as is, or fine-tuned on any IHC musculoskeletal dataset, removing the need for manual segmentation by pathologists and offering a solution to the current image analysis bottleneck.

I am currently cleaning some up some of the code and updating the latest weights, to upload them ASAP. Watch this space!
